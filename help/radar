Gets National Weather Service radar for a location.
`$radar [options] location`
The provided location will be entered into the interactive radar's search box, and the first result will be chosen. If no location is provided, a view of the entire continental United States will be shown.
An animated GIF will be created for the radar at 10-minute intervals over the past 100 minutes.
Note: This process is slow and will take over 15 seconds. In case the command fails (ðŸ’£) or if visual anomalies are observed, it may succeed if retried.

**Options**
`static` Only create a static image of the latest radar instead of a GIF.

**Examples**
`$radar`
`$radar 62025`
`$radar static edwardsville il`
